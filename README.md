## üìù Hackathon task description

> Selected task: **LifeRun** by [ZUS](https://www.zus.pl/)
>
> Time to finish the challenge: **24 hours**.

Life is a constant sequence of decisions that shape the future ‚Äì from education and career choices, through lifestyle and relationships, to financial security in old age. In the rush of everyday life, we rarely reflect on the long-term impact of our actions. How do overwork, lack of savings, or neglecting health affect quality of life later on? And on the other hand ‚Äì how can investing in education, nurturing passions, or maintaining balance between work and family contribute to greater stability and fulfillment in the future? The simulation game Life Run poses a fundamental question: what does a well-planned life really mean? It is not only about finances, but also about health, relationships, and a sense of satisfaction. As part of this challenge, participants will explore these complexities and look for ways to present the consequences of everyday choices in an engaging and accessible way.

## üí° MVP description

> Product name: **Virtual Tomorrow** (**Wirtualne Jutro**).

Virtual Tomorrow is an educational life simulator that teaches strategic financial and career planning. The application visualizes the long-term consequences of decisions, letting players guide a character from youth through to retirement. In a safe, virtual environment, users learn how their choices impact their future well-being and financial security.
